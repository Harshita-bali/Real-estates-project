/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for ApnaAddress Platform
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and allows public read access to property listings
 * while restricting write access to the owner of the property.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`, ensuring each user can only access their own data.
 * - Property listings are stored under `/properties/{propertyId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only manage their own profiles (create, update, delete).
 * - Property listings are publicly readable, but only the owner (creator) can modify or delete them.
 * - Data validation is relaxed in this prototyping phase to allow for schema flexibility,
 *   but critical ownership relationships are strictly enforced.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Each property document contains a `userId` field indicating ownership, avoiding the need for complex lookups.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User profiles and property listings are stored in separate top-level collections to allow for different
 *   security postures (private vs. public read).
